## Example





You will be allowed to use any tools you want to build this website.  We have included some bootstrap samples you can use to build the site.  If you have not used bootstrap before.  Please reference this site: https://getbootstrap.com/.

The csv contains 14 columns that should be searchable through your site.  Whatever the user selects, they should see a graphical representation of the data.  You have an hour and 40 minutes to build the site.  The remaining 20 minutes will be left for groups to present.  The link to the data and bootstrap samples are below.

Sample Info is attached to the repo.

	- Top Ten States with Most Number of Breaches
- Total Individuals Affected by Year


The site is built using Ruby on Rails 5.2.3 and uses:
